# Examples

This directory will contain _very simple_ extension examples.

The intent is to provide a starting point for more elaborate and useful implementations and to demonstrate the use of `extension-cli`. 

### TODO

Plan: implement these using extension v3 manifest, service worker

- [] **Current Time** - shows current time in popup window (add preview)
- [] **Simple Blocker** - create example that blocks requests (add preview)
- [] ???
