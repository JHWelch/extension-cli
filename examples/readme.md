# Examples

This directory will contain _very simple_ extension examples.

The intent is to provide a starting point for more elaborate and useful implementations and to demonstrate the use of `extension-cli`. 

### TODO

Plan: implement these using extension v3 manifest, service worker

- [ ] **Current Time** - shows current time in popup window (add preview)
- [ ] **Simple Blocker** - create example that blocks requests (add preview)

### This directory is currently a stub. In the meantime you can see real use cases [here &rarr;](https://github.com/MobileFirstLLC/extension-cli/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS03NTExMzgyOTQ%3D)
